name: GRN inference benchmark
label: A dynamic benchmark for gene regulatory network (GRN) inference  
motivation: |
  GRNs are essential for understanding cellular identity and behavior. They are simplified models of gene expression regulated by complex processes involving multiple layers of control, from transcription to post-transcriptional modifications, incorporating various regulatory elements and non-coding RNAs. Gene transcription is controlled by a regulatory complex that includes transcription factors (TFs), cis-regulatory elements (CREs) like promoters and enhancers, and essential co-factors. High-throughput datasets, covering thousands of genes, facilitate the use of machine learning approaches to decipher GRNs. The advent of single-cell sequencing technologies, such as scRNA-seq, has made it possible to infer GRNs from a single experiment due to the abundance of samples. This allows researchers to infer condition-specific GRNs, such as for different cell types or diseases, and study potential regulatory factors associated with these conditions. Combining chromatin accessibility data with gene expression measurements has led to the development of enhancer-driven GRN (eGRN) inference pipelines, which offer significantly improved accuracy over single-modality methods.
description: |
  Here, we present a dynamic benchmark platform for GRN inference. This platform provides curated datasets for GRN inference and evaluation, standardized evaluation protocols and metrics, computational infrastructure, and a dynamically updated leaderboard to track state-of-the-art methods. It runs novel GRNs in the cloud, offers competition scores, and stores them for future comparisons, reflecting new developments over time.

  The platform supports the integration of new datasets and protocols. When a new feature is added, previously evaluated GRNs are re-assessed, and the leaderboard is updated accordingly. The aim is to evaluate both the accuracy and completeness of inferred GRNs. It is designed for both single-modality and multi-omics GRN inference. Ultimately, it is a community-driven platform. So far, six eGRN inference methods have been integrated: Scenic+, CellOracle, FigR, scGLUE, GRaNIE, and ANANSE.

  Due to its flexible nature, the platform can incorporate various benchmark datasets and evaluation methods, using either prior knowledge or feature-based approaches. In the current version, due to the absence of standardized prior knowledge, we use a feature-based approach to benchmark GRNs. Our evaluation utilizes standardized datasets for GRN inference and evaluation, employing multiple regression analysis approaches to assess both accuracy and comprehensiveness.
